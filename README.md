# Miscellaneous

Here is a bunch of random stuff I'd like to share, but do not want to create a new repository for.

## Steem Analytics

[Steem Analytics](steem_analytics/SteemAnalytics.ipynb) is an iPython Notebook, where I did some analysis of my activities on the [Steem blockchain](https://steemit.com/). I also wrote a discussion of the results, which I published [of course on Steem](https://steemit.com/steem/@cpufronz/a-data-science-approach-to-steem-upvotes-curation-rewards-and-delegations)
